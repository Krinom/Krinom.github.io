        <h1>My name is Avram lipford</h1>
        <p>I am currently in enrolled in Cybersecurity and Computer science. I have a big interest in coding.
            I really enjoy coding. It can be difficult at times, but it's very fun once you understand how it works.
            When I am not doing schoolwork I like to  workout, play games, read, watch shows/movies, and sleep. </p>
